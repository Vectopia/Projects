Project Objective: Philspel is a very simple and silly spelling checker. It accepts a single command line argument: the file name of a dictionary to use. This project is designed to serve as an introduction to the C language. To complete it, you will have to use the C file input/output library, do memory allocation, manipulate strings, and coerce strings to void pointers and vice versa.
