Objective: This project is designed to be both a C project as well as a performance project. In this project you will be implementing a slower version of numpy. Your version of numpy, numc (how exciting!), is most likely to be slower than numpy, but much faster than the naive implementations of matrix operations. You will first complete a naive solution for some matrix functions in C, then you will experiment with the setup file in Python to install your numc module. After that, you will gain a deeper understanding of the Python-C interface by overloading some operators and defining some instance methods for numc.Matrix objects. Finally, you will speed up your naive solution, thus making numc.Matrix operations faster.
